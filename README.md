## Motivation  
In critical situations, timely alerts can save lives. Many people may be unable to call for help directly due to injury, panic, or inaccessibility.  
This system detects emergencies via audio or text input, classifies the type of emergency, and triggers alerts in real time, helping responders act faster.
